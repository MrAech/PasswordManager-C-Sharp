# My Password Manager Project 🔐
By: 23BCS10596

## Day 1 Progress (June 19, 2025):
Just started working on my password manager! Here's what I did today:

- [x] Created basic project structure
- [x] Made a simple console menu (it works but doesn't do much yet lol)
- [x] Added placeholder classes for:
  - Password model
  - Database stuff (will add real DB tomorrow)
  - Encryption (gotta make it secure!)
  - UI menus

### Project Structure:
```
PasswordManager/
├── Models/
│   └── Password.cs
├── Services/
│   ├── DatabaseService.cs
│   └── EncryptionService.cs
├── UI/
│   └── ConsoleUI.cs
└── Program.cs
```

### Todo for Tomorrow:
- Set up the MySQL database
- Add real database connection
- Start working on the master password system
- Maybe start encryption if I have time

Note to self: Remember to add error handling!
